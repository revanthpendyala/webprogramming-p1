        <p>Users of HTML are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them little control over the 
            way that a page is displayed. It should be remembered that HTML was developed as a means 
            of  marking  up  the  structure  of  a  document  not  as  a  way  of  determining  its  presentation. 
            Formatting text to appear on a Web page is therefore different from formatting text to appear 
            in a printed document. 
            This is 
            Cool.

            <p>“Look at her little legs! Aren’t her little legs just the cutest, chubbiest things?” Grandma exclaimed, holding baby Ellie. 

                Ellie cooed as Grandma pinched her cheek. “And she has the chubbiest little face! Isn’t it adorable? Chunky baby!”
                
                Ellie’s mom smiled. “She’s the cutest baby ever.”
                
                Ellie smiled a toothless smile in agreement. </p>
