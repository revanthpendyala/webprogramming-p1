    Users of HTML are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them little control over the 
    way that a page is displayed. <br> It should be remembered that HTML was developed as a means 
    of  marking  up  the  structure  of  a  document  not  as  a  way  of  determining  its  presentation. 
    <p> text to appear on a Web page is therefore different from formatting text to appear 
    </p>in a printed document.
