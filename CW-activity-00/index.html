        <p>Users of HTML are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them little control over the 
            way that a page is displayed. It should be remembered that HTML was developed as a means 
            of  marking  up  the  structure  of  a  document  not  as  a  way  of  determining  its  presentation. 
            Formatting text to appear on a Web page is therefore different from formatting text to appear 
            in a printed document. 
            This is 
            Cool.
